IQ-TREE multicore version 1.6.12 for Mac OS X 64-bit built Aug 15 2019
Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Command-line examples (replace 'iqtree ...' by actual path to executable):

1. Infer maximum-likelihood tree from a sequence alignment (example.phy)
   with the best-fit model automatically selected by ModelFinder:
     iqtree -s example.phy

2. Perform ModelFinder without subsequent tree inference:
     iqtree -s example.phy -m MF
   (use '-m TEST' to resemble jModelTest/ProtTest)

3. Combine ModelFinder, tree search, ultrafast bootstrap and SH-aLRT test:
     iqtree -s example.phy -alrt 1000 -bb 1000

4. Perform edge-linked proportional partition model (example.nex):
     iqtree -s example.phy -spp example.nex
   (replace '-spp' by '-sp' for edge-unlinked model)

5. Find best partition scheme by possibly merging partitions:
     iqtree -s example.phy -sp example.nex -m MF+MERGE
   (use '-m TESTMERGEONLY' to resemble PartitionFinder)

6. Find best partition scheme followed by tree inference and bootstrap:
     iqtree -s example.phy -spp example.nex -m MFP+MERGE -bb 1000

7. Use 4 CPU cores to speed up computation: add '-nt 4' option

PoMo command-line examples:
1. Standard tree inference (HKY model, empirical nucleotide frequencies):
     iqtree -s counts_file.cf -m HKY+P

2. Set virtual population size to 15:
     iqtree -s counts_file.cf -m HKY+P+N15

3. Use GTR model and estimate state frequencies with maxmimum lilelihood:
     iqtree -s counts_file.cf -m GTR+P+FO

4. Polymorphism-aware mixture model with N=5 and weighted binomial sampling:
     iqtree -s counts_file.cf -m "MIX{HKY+P{EMP},JC+P}+N5+WB"

---
To show all available options: run 'iqtree -h'
